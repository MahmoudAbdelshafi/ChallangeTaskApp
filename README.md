#### What architecture did you use and why ?

  <summary>Solution</summary> 

- MVVM Architecture

MVVM makes the view controller simpler by moving a lot of business logic out of it.
The view model better expresses the business logic for the view.
A view model is much easier to test than a view controller. You end up testing business logic without having to worry about view implementations.

#### Letâ€™s say that your team is working on this app and you're looking to add a new feature. Describe the process that you would follow in your current place of work to bring this from an initial idea to a live feature in production. What are the positives and negatives of this approach?

First I will make an example of this feature.
Second I will bring it up to the table and show it to my team members and we can discuss the feature.
Third if the discussion was positive about my suggestion we can put a plan for the feature, else { I can think in another feature for another discussion :D }
